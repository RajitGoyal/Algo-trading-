Report – Product3: Trend Following Strategy
1. Dataset Exploration
Visual inspection of prices.csv for Product3 showed:
* Trend Behavior: At times, prices either steadily rise or fall for short stretches.

* Momentum Patterns: Sustained price movement in one direction often precedes further continuation.

* Smoother Shifts: Less mean-reverting and more directional than Product2.

2. Strategy Motivation
A trend-following strategy suits this product because:
   * Price changes are not immediately reversed.

   * Capturing early momentum can lead to short-term profits.

   * A classic moving average crossover can identify trend shifts.

3. Core Logic
      * Tracks mid-prices over time.

      * Computes:

         * Short-term average: last 5 prices.

         * Long-term average: last 20 prices.

            * If short > long → uptrend → buy

            * If short < long → downtrend → sell

4. Experiments & Insights
               * Short window = 3 → reacted too quickly; too much noise.

               * Long window > 30 → lagged too much and missed reversals.

               * Final config: 5-short vs. 20-long, volume = 10, balances reactiveness and stability.
