Report – Product1: Market Making Strategy
1. Dataset Exploration
Using the provided prices.csv, I plotted bid and ask prices over time. Key findings:
* Price Range: The product consistently trades within a tight range: around $9995 to $10005.

* Mid Price Stability: The average mid-price hovers close to $10,000 with very small fluctuations.

* Order Book Depth: At each timestamp, up to 3 bids and asks are available. This allows for constant spread-based opportunities.

2. Strategy Motivation
Given the stable price range and visible spread in the orderbook, a Market Making strategy is ideal.
   * Market makers profit from placing simultaneous buy and sell orders on both sides of the spread.

   * With prices bouncing within a narrow band, this lets us accumulate small profits repeatedly without directional bets.

3. Core Logic
      * Computed the mid-price using the best bid and best ask.

      * Placed a buy order just below the mid-price (e.g., mid - 1).

      * Placed a sell order just above the mid-price (e.g., mid + 1).

      * Used modest order volume (10) to avoid breaching ±50 position limits.

4. Experiments & Insights
         * Using a larger volume increased profit but caused rejections due to position limits.

         * Tighter spreads (mid ± 0) sometimes got filled faster but reduced profitability.

         * Wider spreads (mid ± 2) reduced fill rate significantly.

Optimal setup: mid ± 1 with quantity = 10.
