Report – Product2: Mean Reversion Strategy
1. Dataset Exploration
Analysis of the prices.csv for Product2 showed:
* Mid-price Fluctuations: Prices slightly oscillate around a central mean (approx. $10,000).

* Short-Term Volatility: Temporary deviations (up to ±2) from the average occur but often revert.

* Price Reversion Patterns: Sudden up/down movements are usually followed by a return to the average.

2. Strategy Motivation
The observed behavior indicates a mean-reverting asset.
   * If the price drops well below the recent average, it's likely to bounce back.

   * If it spikes above average, it's likely to revert downward.

   * I exploited these short-term price inefficiencies.

3. Core Logic
      * Tracked recent mid-prices over a window of 10.

      * Calculates the average mid-price.

      * If current mid-price < average − 1 → places a buy order.

      * If current mid-price > average + 1 → places a sell order.
      * 4. Experiments & Insights
         * Increasing the rolling window size to 20 made the algorithm too slow to respond.

         * Using a window size < 5 caused overtrading on noise.

         * Adding a threshold of ±1 ensured less frequent but higher-confidence trades.

Optimal setup: 10-period average with ±1 threshold, volume = 10.
