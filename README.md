### Summary of what I have learnt in SOC so far

## Basic Concepts
What is Algorithmic Trading: I understood that algorithmic trading involves using computer programs to automatically place trades based on predefined strategies.

Why Algo Trading is Useful: It removes human emotions, works faster, and helps make consistent decisions using data.

## Strategy Building
How to Design a Trading Strategy: I learned how to break down a strategy into clear rules like when to buy and when to sell.

Key Factors in a Strategy: Some important things are selecting indicators, choosing timeframes, and setting risk limits.

## Backtesting
I understood how to test a strategy using past data to check if it would have worked before actually using it in real-time.

## Order System
I learned about how buy/sell orders are created in a trading system using classes like Order, and how trades are executed.

## Coding and Implementation
I worked with a basic Python framework to code trading strategies using simple logic and submit them as .py files.

Got familiar with submitting 3 different strategy files for 3 different products as per the assignment format.
